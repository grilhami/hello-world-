# hello-world-

Hello Everybody! This is my Github. What i would like to do here is share and help.
My mind is a factory of imaginations. There's alot of crazy and weird stuff in there.

I'm ne in the world of Web Development and i want to develop myself as a developer 
with the latest technology. Adn i think the best way to learn is by doing, sharing, 
and helping. So i'm going to share some of mt inspirations here on my github so it 
can be used for future purposes. 

Nice to see you all! Have fun!
